      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Amplify is a grassroots, community-driven initiative committed to
        connecting Canadian musicians with venues to showcase their music. Our
        mission is to amplify emerging and journey-level musicians by providing
        access to real stages, real crowds, and real community support.
        <br /><br />
        Many musicians lack the connections or means to book a venue on their own.
        Amplify helps break down those barriers by organizing regular open mic nights
        and showcase events. Whether you're an up-and-coming singer-songwriter or
        an acoustic duo looking for a chance to be heard, Amplify exists to give
        you that platform.
        <br /><br />
        We're not just about performance—we're building a collaborative scene where
        musicians, fans, and venues grow together. All styles and genres are welcome.
        The vibe is intimate and acoustic—meant to enhance, not overpower, the room.
        <br /><br />
        Current and upcoming venues include:
